==========

C implementation of the Hashlife algorithm

- 30/01/13 Initializing OKAY.

- 30/11/13 Rewrote hashlife.c and Cie.

    1. for a more spaced writing style (`a+b` -> `a + b`)

    2. the computation of `next` (the configuration in 2^d steps) should be
done by an explicit call rather than by a "smart constructor".
